📌 How It Works
Dynamic Destination Cards
On page load, script.js dynamically generates cards for destinations defined in a JavaScript array and injects them into the DOM.

Carousel
The #featuredCarousel displays a rotating set of highlighted travel spots using Bootstrap’s Carousel component.

Contact Form Validation
The form checks that all fields are filled before allowing submission and displays a thank-you alert.

✨ How to Use
Clone or download the project files.

Open index.html in a web browser.

Interact with the carousel, explore destinations, and try the contact form.
